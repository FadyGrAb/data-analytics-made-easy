    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
        Are you a data beginner? Do you want to break in the data world? Do you feel overwhelmed and don't know from
        where to start? ðŸ˜•</p>
    <p><strong>Yup! You are not alone! I've been there too!** âœ‹</strong></p>
    <p>When I started to seriously learn about data around in early 2018, I felt like I was swimming in the middle of a
        storm in the ocean without a life jacket! Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit but that more or less I've felt specially
        that I don't come from an IT background as I'm a telecommunications professional.</p>
    <p>I've struggled my way through and looked into every resource I can get my hand on to raise my data awareness. I
        managed to be a decent data engineer (yay!) and I successfully passed a number of cloud certs regarding Data
        Engineering and Data Analytics (You can know all about me from my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fady-abdelmassih/" target="_blank">LindedIn Profile</a>).</p>
    <p><strong><i>"Data Analytics Made Easy"</i></strong> is the guide I wish I had when I was learning about data. You
        will have all the basic knowledge about Data Engineering and AWS to help you start your Data career.
