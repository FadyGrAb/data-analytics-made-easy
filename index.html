    <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
        Are you a data beginner? Do you want to break in the data world? Do you feel overwhelmed and don't know from
        where to start? ðŸ˜•</p>
    <p><strong>Yup! You are not alone! I've been there too! âœ‹</strong></p>
    <p>When I started to seriously learn about data around in early 2018, I felt like I was swimming in the middle of a
        storm in the ocean without a life jacket! Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit but that more or less I've felt specially
        that I don't come from an IT background as I'm a telecommunications professional.</p>
    <p>I've struggled my way through and looked into every resource I can get my hand on to raise my data awareness. I
        managed to be a decent data engineer (yay!) and I successfully passed a number of cloud certs regarding Data
        Engineering and Data Analytics (You can know all about me from my <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fady-abdelmassih/" target="_blank">LindedIn Profile</a>).</p>
    <p><strong><i>"Data Analytics Made Easy"</i></strong> is the guide I wish I had when I was learning about data. You
        will have all the basic knowledge about Data Engineering and AWS to help you start your Data career.
    </p>
    <h1>My Motivation</h1>
    <p>
        Like I've said, when I started learning about data, I felt overwhelmed! I wished I had a comprehensive guide or
        a roadmap to help me. And now that I know a thing or two about data,
        I want to share that with all the data beginners out there so they have a better start than me!
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, I'll be creating videos in Arabic as I don't find many Arabic content covering Data Analytics. In my
        opinion, this will break the language barrier that some may have and
        help spread Data Analytics between Arabic speaker in the Arab world and Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aaaand one last thing! I've told you that I love learning, I've found out that the best way for me to get better
        at Data Analytics (or at anything) is to
        learn it to other people! So, <i>you are actually helping me here</i> ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
    <h1>The series structure</h1>
    <p>
        Mainly, I've split what I want to share into 6 categories that spans over the Data Engineering landscape:
    <ul>
        <li>Basic</li>
        <li>Collection</li>
        <li>Storage</li>
        <li>Processing</li>
        <li>Analysis</li>
        <li>Visualization</li>
    </ul>
    In each category, I'll talk about 4 topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Theory</li>
        <li>Open Source Software and tools</li>
        <li>AWS</i>
        <li>Mini-project(s)</li>
    </ul>
    I'll produce weekly content in the form of a video in <i>Arabic</i> on my <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/@YetAnotherDataGuy" target="_blank">Yet Another Data Guy</a> YouTube Channel and a
    companion article in <i>English</i> at <a href="dev.to" target="_blank">dev.to</a> in a series with the
    name "data analytics made easy". So, make sure that you <a href="https://dev.to/fadygrab" target="_blank">follow me
        there</a> as
    well. Each category may have one or more mini-projects. The source code of those mini-projects will be in this <a
        href="https://github.com/FadyGrAb/data-analytics-made-easy" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.
