# Data Analytics Made Easy

Are you a data beginner? Do you want to break in the data world? Do you feel overwhelmed and don't know from where to start? ðŸ˜•  
<br>**Yup! You are not alone! I've been there too!** âœ‹  
<br>When I started to seriously learn about data around in early 2018, I felt like I was swimming in the middle of a storm in the ocean without a life jacket! Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit but that more or less I've felt specially that I don't come from an IT background as I'm a telecommunications professional.  
I've struggled my way through and looked into every resource I can get my hand on to raise my data awareness. I managed to be a decent data engineer (yay!) and I successfully passed a number of cloud certs regarding Data Engineering and Data Analytics (You can know all about me from my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fady-abdelmassih/)).  
___"Data Analytics Made Easy"___ is the guide I wish I had when I was learning about data. You will have all the basic knowledge about Data Engineering and AWS to help you start you Data career.
